    "bio": "The least Cornish of the group, Melodye hails from the United States with Oklahoma roots but claims New York. She studied Musical Theatre in New York City and has worked all over the world in some of the oddest of jobs. She was a [Big Piano dancer at FAO Schwarz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAB_4OJvkbk&list=FLuV2to4nwqcl8S9IFUQazCQ&index=7) for several years, acted as a patient for medical students, performed as a dancing Care Bear in Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, featured in German \"Elle\" for her job as a Professional Wingwoman, worked as a general assistant at McMurdo Station in Antarctica, traveled to all 7 continents before turning 30, and hosted live cooking shows and wine events on cruise ships.\n\n Upon falling for a Cornish officer on an aforementioned cruise ship, she moved to Penryn in 2017 and continued to fall in love with the people and culture of Cornwall. Ever the fan girl of shanties and Betty Stoggs, she feels incredibly grateful to the Falmouth Fish for taking her under their wing (fin). After so many years in NYC, she still struggles with the experience of \"dreckly,\" but she couldn't imagine herself anywhere else."
